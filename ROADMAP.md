# RFP Automation System - Feature Roadmap

This document outlines the planned unique features to differentiate the RFP Automation System.

## 🚀 Unique "Wow" Features

### 1. 🕵️ "Rigged Spec" Detector
**Concept**: Use AI to analyze RFP technical specifications and flag requirements that seem tailor-made for a specific competitor (e.g., highly specific non-standard dimensions or obscure materials).
**Value**: Helps the sales team decide whether to No-Go early or challenge the spec, saving time on lost causes.

### 2. 📉 Live Metal Price Hedging
**Concept**: Integrate with London Metal Exchange (LME) or similar APIs to fetch real-time Copper and Aluminum prices.
**Value**: Auto-adjusts valid-until dates on quotes and suggests hedging strategies (e.g., "Book raw materials today to lock in 15% margin").

### 3. 🎛️ "What-If" Margin Simulator
**Concept**: An interactive UI with sliders for Profit Margin, Delivery Speed, and Payment Terms.
**Value**: Instantly visualizes how these changes impact the **Win Probability Score** and **Net Profit**, allowing for optimal bid strategizing.

### 4. 🧬 Dynamic Product Genealogist
**Concept**: A visual graph (Node-link diagram) showing the "ancestry" of a proposed product—tracing it back to raw materials, sub-suppliers, and manufacturing lines.
**Value**: Demonstrates supply chain transparency and quality control to the client.

### 5. 🗺️ Geospatial Opportunity Heatmap
**Concept**: A map view displaying active RFPs, clustered by region, overlaid with factory locations and logistics hubs.
**Value**: Helps identify clusters of opportunities to optimize delivery costs (e.g., "We have 3 bids in Texas, let's lower shipping estimate by grouping").

### 6. 🎙️ Voice-to-Spec "Field Mode"
**Concept**: A mobile-optimized interface where a sales rep can record a voice note after a client meeting (e.g., "Client needs 5km of 11kV cable, but with red sheath, delivery in 3 weeks").
**Value**: AI transcribes and extracts technical specs directly into a Draft RFP, eliminating manual data entry.

### 7. ✅ "One-Click" Compliance Matrix
**Concept**: Automatically generate the line-by-line Compliance Matrix Excel sheet required by most formal tenders.
**Value**: Saves hours of tedious copy-pasting from PDF to Excel.

## 📅 Immediate Next Steps
1.  **Refine Email Ingestion**: [Completed] - PDF detection and Inbox UI.
2.  **Select Next "Wow" Feature**: User to prioritize from the list above.
